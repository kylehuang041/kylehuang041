# 👋 Kyle Huang
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I specialize in full-stack and AI development, and I enjoy learning new concepts and technologies to further my expertise. I'm familiar with team-based development and communication as I have multiple startup experience. I'm also quick to adapt to different technologies and team changes. So, I'm flexible and a learner.
